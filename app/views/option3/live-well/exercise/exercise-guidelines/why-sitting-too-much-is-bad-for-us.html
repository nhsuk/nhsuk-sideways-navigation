    <p data-block-key="icbzb">The link between illness and sitting first emerged in the 1950s, when researchers found double decker bus drivers were twice as likely to have heart attacks as their bus conductor colleagues. The drivers sat for 90 per cent of their shifts, the conductors climbed about 600 stairs each working day.</p><p data-block-key="amjzj">It is thought excessive sitting slows the metabolism – which affects our ability to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure, and metabolise fat – and may cause weaker muscles and bones.</p><p data-block-key="zudfz">Research on astronauts in the early 1970s found life in zero gravity was linked with accelerated bone and muscle loss and ageing.</p>
