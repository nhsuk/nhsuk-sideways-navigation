      <h2>Your rights at work while you're pregnant</h2>
    

    
      
        
          



    <p>If you're working while you're pregnant, you need to know your rights to antenatal care, maternity leave and <a href="/pregnancy/finding-out/maternity-and-paternity-benefits-and-leave/">benefits</a>.</p><p>If you have any worries about your health while at work, talk to your doctor, midwife or occupational health nurse.</p><p>You can also talk to your employer, union representative, or someone in the personnel department (HR) where you work.</p><p>Once you tell your employer that you're pregnant, they should do a risk assessment with you to see if your job poses any risks to you or your baby.</p><p>If there are any risks, they have to make reasonable adjustments to remove them. This can include changing your working hours.</p><p>If you work with chemicals, lead or X-rays, or in a job with a lot of lifting, it may be illegal for you to continue to work.</p><p>In this case, your employer must offer you alternative work on the same terms and conditions as your original job.</p><p>If there's no safe alternative, your employer should suspend you on full pay (give you paid leave) for as long as necessary to avoid the risk.</p><p>If your employer fails to pay you during your suspension, you can bring a claim in an employment tribunal (within 3 months). This wouldn't affect your maternity pay or maternity leave. The GOV.UK website has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave">more information about maternity pay and leave.</a></p><p>You may worry about using computer screens in pregnancy. But the most recent research shows no evidence of a risk to your baby or pregnancy from visual display units (VDUs) on computers.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights">GOV.UK</a>, <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/discrimination-at-work/what-are-the-different-types-of-discrimination/pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination-at-work/">Citizens Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.maternityaction.org.uk/work-and-benefits/">Maternity Action</a> have more information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights">pregnant employees' rights</a>, including your right to paid time off for antenatal care and what to do if you feel you're being treated unfairly.</p><p></p>

      <h2>Coping with pregnancy symptoms at work</h2>
    

    
      
        
          



    <p>You might get more tired than usual, particularly in the first and last few <a href="/pregnancy/week-by-week/">weeks of pregnancy</a>.</p><p>Try to use your lunch break to eat and rest. If travelling in rush hour is exhausting, ask your employer if you can work slightly different hours for a while.</p><p>Don't rush home and start another job cleaning and cooking. If possible, ask your friend, partner or a member of your family to help you.</p><p>Read more about <a href="/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/tiredness/">tiredness in pregnancy</a>.</p><p>If you're struggling with nausea and vomiting (morning sickness), you might be finding it hard at work.</p><p>You can ask your employer about working slightly different hours to avoid times when you feel worse, or working from home on days when the morning sickness is bad.</p><p>Speak to a GP or midwife if you feel particularly bad or unwell.</p><p>Read more about <a href="/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/">vomiting and morning sickness</a>.</p>
