    <p data-block-key="loaid">Some women prefer not to travel in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy because of&nbsp;<a href="/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/">nausea and vomiting</a> and feeling very tired during these early stages. The risk of&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/miscarriage/">miscarriage</a> is also higher in the first 3 months, whether you're travelling or not.</p><p data-block-key="4mxak">Travelling in the final months of pregnancy can be tiring and uncomfortable. So, many women find the best time to travel or take a holiday is in mid-pregnancy, between 4 and 6 months.</p>

    <p data-block-key="myfzo">Flying isn't harmful to you or your baby, but discuss any health issues or pregnancy complications with your midwife or doctor before you fly.</p><p data-block-key="1e0xz">The chance of going into labour is naturally higher after&nbsp;<a href="/pregnancy/week-by-week/28-to-40-plus/37-weeks/">37 weeks</a> (around 32 weeks if you're carrying twins), and some airlines won't let you fly towards the end of your pregnancy. Check with the airline for their policy on this.</p><p data-block-key="s4hub">After week 28 of pregnancy, the airline may ask for a letter from your doctor or midwife confirming your due date, and that you are not at risk of complications. You may have to pay for the letter and wait several weeks before you get it.</p><p data-block-key="1yc3r">Long-distance travel (longer than 4 hours) carries a small risk of blood clots <a href="/conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/">(deep vein thrombosis (DVT))</a>. If you fly, drink plenty of water and move about regularly â€“ every 30 minutes or so. You can buy a pair of graduated compression or&nbsp;support stockings&nbsp;from the pharmacy, which will help&nbsp;reduce leg swelling.</p><p data-block-key="0g3mq"></p>

Ask your GP or midwife for advice about specific travel vaccinations. Non-live (inactivated) vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy.</p>

    <p data-block-key="nni2u">It's best to avoid long car journeys if you're pregnant. However, if it can't be avoided, make sure you stop regularly and get out of the car to stretch and move around.</p><p data-block-key="f0pzq">You can also do some exercises in the car (when you're not driving), such as flexing and rotating your feet and wiggling your toes. This will keep the blood flowing through your legs and reduce any stiffness and discomfort. Wearing compression stockings while on long car journeys (more than 4 hours) can also increase the blood flow in your legs and help prevent blood clots.</p><p data-block-key="ugka1">Tiredness and dizziness are common during pregnancy so it's important on car journeys&nbsp;to drink regularly and eat natural, energy-giving foods, such as fruit and nuts.</p><p data-block-key="fit21">Keep the air circulating in the car and wear your seatbelt with the cross strap between your breasts and the lap strap across your pelvis&nbsp;under your bump,&nbsp;not across your bump.</p><p data-block-key="5k36y">Road accidents are among the most common causes of injury in pregnant women. If you have to make a long trip, don't travel on your own. You could also share the driving with your companion.</p>
