    <p data-block-key="sf1tw">Whooping cough (pertussis)&nbsp;rates have risen sharply in recent years and babies who are too young to start their vaccinations are at greatest risk.</p><p data-block-key="4x8fb">Young babies with <a href="/conditions/whooping-cough/">whooping cough</a> are often very unwell and most will be admitted to hospital because of their illness. When whooping cough is particularly severe, they can die.</p><p data-block-key="qhlyl">Pregnant women&nbsp;can help protect their babies by getting vaccinated – ideally&nbsp;from&nbsp;16 weeks up to 32 weeks pregnant.&nbsp;If for any reason you miss having the vaccine, you can still have it up until you go into labour.</p>

    <p data-block-key="riyxm">Getting vaccinated while you're pregnant&nbsp;is highly effective in protecting your baby from developing whooping cough in&nbsp;the&nbsp;first few weeks of their life.</p><p data-block-key="5dpfs">The immunity you get from the vaccine will pass to your baby through the placenta and provide passive protection&nbsp;for them until they are old enough to be&nbsp;routinely vaccinated against whooping cough&nbsp;at 8 weeks old.</p>

    <p data-block-key="8z4js">The best time to get vaccinated to protect your baby from whooping cough is from&nbsp;16 weeks up to 32 weeks of pregnancy. This maximises the chance that your baby will be protected&nbsp;from birth, through the transfer of your antibodies before he or she is born.</p><p data-block-key="mjpwd">If for any reason you miss having the vaccine, you can still have it up until you go into labour. However, this is not ideal, as your baby is less likely to get protection from you. At this stage of pregnancy, having the vaccination may not directly protect your baby, but would help protect you from whooping cough and from passing it on to your baby.</p>

    <p data-block-key="gdm0t">It's&nbsp;understandable that you might have concerns about&nbsp;the safety of&nbsp;having a vaccine&nbsp;during pregnancy, but there's no evidence to suggest that the whooping cough vaccine is unsafe for&nbsp;you&nbsp;or your unborn baby.</p><p data-block-key="kvkrq">Pertussis-containing vaccine (whooping cough vaccine)&nbsp;has been used routinely in pregnant women in the UK since October 2012, and the&nbsp;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)&nbsp;is carefully monitoring&nbsp;its safety.</p><p data-block-key="1b51b">The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4219">MHRA's study of&nbsp;around 20,000 vaccinated women published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ)</a> found no evidence of risks to pregnancy or babies.</p><p data-block-key="q3x5z">A number of other countries, including the US, Argentina, Belgium, Spain, Australia and&nbsp;New Zealand, currently recommend vaccination against whooping cough&nbsp;in pregnancy.</p><p data-block-key="chb9a">Read more about <a href="/conditions/vaccinationswhy-vaccination-is-important-and-the-safest-way-to-protect-yourself/">why vaccines are safe and important</a>.</p>

    <p data-block-key="2ar4b">Yes, it is. Published research from the UK vaccination programme shows that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough has been highly effective in protecting young babies until they can have their first vaccination when they are 8 weeks old.</p><p data-block-key="1wzbb">Babies born to women vaccinated at least a week before birth had a 91% reduced risk of becoming ill with whooping cough in their first weeks of life, compared to babies whose mothers had not been vaccinated.</p><p data-block-key="97gt2">An additional benefit is that the protection the mother receives from the vaccination will lower her own risk of infection and of passing whooping cough on to her baby.</p>

    <p data-block-key="he3qn">As there is no whooping cough-only vaccine, the vaccine you'll be given also protects against polio, diphtheria and tetanus.&nbsp;The vaccine is called&nbsp;Boostrix IPV.</p><p data-block-key="uzmsw">Boostrix IPV&nbsp;is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the <a href="/conditions/vaccinations4-in-1-pre-school-dtap-ipv-booster/">4-in-1 vaccine</a> – the pre-school booster that's routinely given to children before they start school.&nbsp;</p><p data-block-key="gwmzc">You can read the manufacturer's <a href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.5302.pdf">patient information leaflet for Boostrix IPV (PDF, 132kb)</a>.</p>

    <p data-block-key="cu3ur">After having the whooping cough vaccine, you may have some mild side effects such as swelling, redness or tenderness where the vaccine is injected in your upper arm. This is normal after having a vaccine and it should only last a few days.</p><p data-block-key="96uri">Other side effects can include a high temperature, irritation at the injection site, nausea and loss of appetite, tiredness and headache. Serious side effects are extremely rare.</p>

    <p data-block-key="sng67">Whooping cough (medically known as pertussis)&nbsp;is a serious infection that causes long bouts of coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe. The "whoop" is caused by gasping for breath after each bout of coughing, though babies do not always make this noise.</p><p data-block-key="b29k1">Read more about <a href="/conditions/whooping-cough/">whooping cough symptoms</a>.</p>

      <h2>Should&nbsp;I be concerned about&nbsp;whooping cough?</h2>
    

    
      
        
          



    <p data-block-key="xx7ww">Whooping cough is a highly infectious, serious illness that can lead to&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/pneumonia/">pneumonia</a> and brain damage, particularly in young babies. Most babies with whooping cough will need hospital treatment, and when whooping cough is very severe they may die.</p><p data-block-key="6cyje">Research from the vaccination programme in England shows that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough has been highly effective in protecting young&nbsp;babies until they can receive their own vaccinations from 8 weeks of age.</p><p data-block-key="pwa7n">In keeping with usual disease patterns, which see cases&nbsp;increasing every 3 to 4 years in England,&nbsp;whooping cough cases have fallen in all age groups since 2012. The greatest fall has been in young babies targeted by the pregnancy vaccination programme.</p><p data-block-key="6j8zx">Cases of whooping cough in older age groups are still high compared to pre-2012 levels. The number of cases&nbsp;was particularly high in 2016, in line with the typical 3- to 4-yearly peak in disease rates.</p><p data-block-key="8ije4">Babies can be infected by people with whooping cough in these older age groups, so it is still important for pregnant women to be vaccinated to protect their babies.</p>

      <h2>But&nbsp;are babies not vaccinated against whooping cough to protect them?</h2>
    

    
      
        
          



    <p data-block-key="co3q0">Yes, they are, but the babies that have been getting whooping cough are generally too young to have started their normal vaccinations, so they are not protected against the condition.</p>

      <h2>So, how can I protect my baby against whooping cough?</h2>
    

    
      
        
          



    <p data-block-key="4fxtl">The only way you can help protect your baby from getting whooping cough in their first few weeks after birth is by having the whooping cough vaccination yourself while you are pregnant.</p><p data-block-key="e3uy9">After vaccination, your body produces antibodies to protect against whooping cough. You will then pass some immunity to your unborn baby.</p>

      <h2>Will&nbsp;the whooping cough vaccine&nbsp;in pregnancy give me whooping cough?</h2>
    

    
      
        
          



    <p data-block-key="5uxbu">No. The whooping cough vaccine is not a "live" vaccine. This means it does not contain whooping cough (or polio, diphtheria or tetanus), and cannot cause whooping cough in you, or in your baby.</p>

    <p data-block-key="r2jjr">Yes. Whenever you have the whooping cough vaccine, your baby will still need to be&nbsp;vaccinated according to the normal <a href="/conditions/vaccinationsnhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/">NHS vaccination schedule</a> when&nbsp;they reach 8 weeks old. Babies are protected against whooping cough&nbsp;by the <a href="/conditions/vaccinations6-in-1-infant-vaccine/">6-in-1 vaccine</a>.</p>

    <p data-block-key="yjdvz">Yes, you can have the whooping cough vaccine when you get the flu vaccine, but do not&nbsp;delay your&nbsp;<a href="/pregnancy/keeping-well/flu-jab">flu jab</a> so that you can have both at the same time.</p>

    <p data-block-key="0rxu6">The vaccine is available from your GP, though some antenatal clinics also offer it. You&nbsp;may be&nbsp;offered the vaccination at a routine antenatal appointment from around&nbsp;16 weeks of your pregnancy.</p><p data-block-key="0vvrp">If you are more than&nbsp;16 weeks pregnant and have not been offered the vaccine, talk&nbsp;to your&nbsp;midwife or GP and make an appointment to get vaccinated.</p>

    <p data-block-key="c1lgh">Yes, because any protection you may have had through either having whooping cough or being vaccinated when you were young is likely to have worn off and will not provide sufficient protection for your baby.</p>

    <p data-block-key="z921s">Yes, you should get re-vaccinated from&nbsp;16 weeks in each pregnancy to maximise protection for your baby.</p>

    <p data-block-key="5qv4t">Be alert to the <a href="/conditions/whooping-cough/">signs and symptoms of whooping cough</a>, which include severe coughing fits that may be accompanied by difficulty breathing (or pauses in breathing in young infants) or vomiting after coughing, and the characteristic "whoop" sound.
